This project focuses on analyzing the performance of international football teams over time using historical match data. The dataset contains information about matches, including scores, dates, and participating teams. The analysis aims to provide insights into various aspects of team performance, such as points earned, goals scored and conceded, and win percentages. It also explores data visualization techniques to highlight the performance of specific teams and their evolution over time.
The key steps in this project include data preprocessing, creating separate datasets for different tournaments, calculating and visualizing team statistics, and generating visualizations to showcase team performance and point accumulation. The project utilizes Python programming, data manipulation with pandas, data visualization with matplotlib, and incorporates features like line plots, scatter plots, and pie charts to present the findings effectively.
By analyzing this soccer match data, the project aims to offer a comprehensive view of team performance, allowing sports enthusiasts and analysts to gain valuable insights into the dynamics of soccer competitions.
